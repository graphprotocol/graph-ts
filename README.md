# The Graph TypeScript Library (graph-ts)

[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@graphprotocol/graph-ts.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-ts)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-ts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-ts)

TypeScript/AssemblyScript library for writing subgraph mappings to be
deployed to [The Graph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).

## Usage

For a detailed guide on how to create a subgraph, please see the
[Graph CLI docs](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli).

One step of creating the subgraph is writing mappings that will process
blockchain events and will write entities into the store. These mappings
are written in TypeScript/AssemblyScript.

The `graph-ts` library provides APIs to access the Graph Node store,
blockchain data, smart contracts, data on IPFS, cryptographic functions
and more. To use it, all you have to do is add a dependency on it:

```sh
npm install --dev @graphprotocol/graph-ts # NPM
yarn add --dev @graphprotocol/graph-ts    # Yarn
```

After that, you can import the `store` API and other features from
this library in your mappings. A few examples:

```typescript
import { store, crypto, Entity } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

// This is just an example event type generated by `graph-cli`
// from an Ethereum smart contract ABI
import { NameRegistered } from './abis/SomeContract'

function handleNameRegistered(event: NameRegistered) {
  let name = event.params.name
  let owner = event.params.owner

  // Example use of a crypto function
  let id = crypto.keccak256(name).toHex()

  // Example use of the `Entity` class
  let entity = new Entity()
  entity.setString('id', id)
  entity.setBytes('name', name)
  entity.setAddress('owner', address)

  // Example use of the store API
  store.set('Name', id, entity)
}
```

## API

We will document the functionality provided by `graph-ts` soon. Until
then, please check the types and modules exported from the
[library source code](index.ts).
